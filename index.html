                <p>Welcome to my page! I am currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Web Development course and so this page will evolve as I learn more and more throughout the course.</p>
                <p>I was born in Southern California and moved to Utah at a young age; I've lived here ever since. I have learned many skills throughout my entire work history but my love for computers and the tech industry isn't something that I have as part of my work history; it's been more of a personal hobby.</p>
                <p>I've always excelled at math and I thought that engineering would be the way to go since I have a strong mechanical aptitude but then came to realize that my mechanical aptitude was just my ability to think logically. I enrolled at Utah Valley University into their Computer Engineering program. I then realized that I didn't like the engineering aspect of the course but I do enjoy the programming part of it. I left UVU and enrolled in the University of Utah's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp where I am learning to develop web pages on both the front and back ends.</p>
